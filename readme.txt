Hello, This is a desktop app launcher, intended to "replace" the start menu, also being much faster than the start menu, and also doubling as a stylish background.
Unfortunately, apps like Wallpaper Engine and other apps like it will not work with this app.
To change the font, simply go to C:\Windows\Fonts and then copy and paste a font from there or you can use Google Fonts, which usually gives you a .zip file once you download a font
and then you can just extract that and put the .ttf file into the same directory as the app and config.json
I'm sorry about the app using 30-40MB of RAM, but the tools required to make this in Python, the only language I can really code and debug in, take that much memory to be used
However, apps like Wallpaper engine use a few gigabytes of ram, which i think is far less than what this app can even do
To close the app, just press alt and f4 or end the task in Task Manager

THIS APP ONLY SUPPORTS .ttf FILES AS FONTS AND USES HEX CODE FOR COLORS, AND REQUIRES THE DIRECTORY OF THE .ttf FILE IN CONFIG

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Paste the directory along with the file name to change the font like so:
C:\\Users\\User1\\Documents\\BasicAppLauncherInstallerSource\\CascadiaCode.ttf
DO NOT USE THIS DIRECTORY
DO DOUBLE BACK SLASHES INSTEAD OF ONE ALWAYS, otherwise the app will not work
This directory is a random directory that I copied and pasted because at the time of writing this I'm watching an anime and also actively making the installer for this program
I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS ON WINDOWS VERSIONS PREVIOUS TO WINDOWS 11, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
I also have not tested the automatic startup feature, so also use at your own risk
